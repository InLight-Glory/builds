### In a world ravaged by plague, you are the last hope.

**Antidote** is not just a game; it's a testament to the enduring human spirit. In a post-apocalyptic world, where a horrifying plague has turned most of humanity into "The-Gray," you are an Engineer armed with the knowledge and technology to reverse the tide. This is not a story about survival of the fittest, but about restoring a fractured world, one life at a time.

This project is an ambitious blend of **First-Person Shooter (FPS)**, **Real-Time Strategy (RTS)**, and **Tower Defense** built from the ground up with **Three.js**.

## The Mission: Reclaim, Rebuild, Restore

Your mission is to push back the encroaching darkness and re-establish a beacon of hope for humanity. You will achieve this by:

* **Curing "The-Gray":** Engage in a multi-step process to cure the infected, transforming them from hostiles back into human survivors.
* **Building and Defending:** Establish and fortify bases to protect your resources and the cured survivors from relentless waves of enemies.
* **Leading and Conquering:** Recruit cured survivors as leaders, each with unique strengths and weaknesses, to help you reclaim all 12 regions of the world.

## Key Features

* **Hybrid Gameplay:** Seamlessly switch between the intense, up-close action of an FPS and the strategic overview of an RTS map mode.
* **Dynamic World:** Experience a full day-night cycle with dynamic lighting and weather that impacts gameplay.
* **Intricate Curing Mechanic:** A challenging 5-step process to cure the infected, requiring skill, precision, and strategy.
* **Resource Management:** Gather essential resources like food, antidote components, and building materials to fuel your efforts.
* **Advanced AI:** Command AI robot units to help you gather, build, fight, and explore. Face off against intelligent enemies, including "The-Gray" and the parasitic "Dark-Grey" swarms.
* **Modular and Expandable:** Built with a modular file structure and a focus on clean, readable code, making it easy to expand and build upon.

## The Technology

* **Engine:** `Three.js`
* **Frontend:** `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`
* **Backend (Future):** `PHP/Database` for a potential helper system
