**Vessels of Sanctuary** is a fast-paced, team-based Action MOBA for the web, built around a revolutionary core mechanic: the **Echo System**. In a world shattered by a reality-bending cataclysm, you are a Conductor, projecting your will into perfect reconstructions of legendary heroes and villains to fight a war trapped in a tragic time loop.

## About The Game
[cite_start]The world of Gray-Earth is broken[cite: 1]. [cite_start]An age of unprecedented harmony, built upon the resonant power of a mysterious material called The Keystone, was shattered by a cataclysm known as **The Fracture**[cite: 3, 16, 1]. [cite_start]This event cracked reality itself, flooding the world with a toxic, reality-warping energy called the Static Miasma[cite: 17, 18].

[cite_start]Now, the last remnants of civilization huddle in two rival Sanctuaries, each built around a massive, stable fragment of The Keystone[cite: 22, 23]. [cite_start]Believing the other is a corruption that perpetuates the chaos, they are locked in a desperate war for the planet's future[cite: 25, 26, 27].

[cite_start]You are a **Conductor**, your mind linked directly to your Sanctuary's Keystone[cite: 28, 29]. [cite_start]From this link, you manifest **Echoes**‚Äîperfect physical reconstructions of legendary figures from across time, known as Vessels[cite: 33]. But you are trapped. [cite_start]Unbeknownst to all, the war is a self-perpetuating cycle[cite: 67]. [cite_start]Each time one Sanctuary achieves victory, the resulting imbalance resets the timeline, and the war begins anew[cite: 72, 73]. [cite_start]Your greatest triumph is your ultimate defeat[cite: 74].

[cite_start]Can you uncover the fragmented truths hidden within the loop and find a way to break the cycle? [cite: 78]

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **üåÄ The Echo System:** Instantly swap between your two chosen Vessels with a **5-second cooldown**. Dodge lethal blows, create mind-bending combos, and manage two health and energy bars. Your inactive Vessel doesn't heal, so knowing when to fight and when to recall is paramount.

* **üîó Unified Itemization:** A single item build applies to **both** of your Vessels. This creates incredible strategic depth, forcing you to purchase items that benefit your entire pairing. Will you build pure damage and risk a fragile support, or find the perfect hybrid build to make your duo an unstoppable force?

* **‚öîÔ∏è True Action Combat:** No point-and-click. With **WASD movement** and a mouse-driven camera, every move is under your direct control. Land skill shots, dodge attacks, and master a combat system featuring light, heavy, and special ability attacks.

* **üó∫Ô∏è Dynamic Map Objectives:** The jungle is alive with strategic opportunities. Capture asymmetric **Temples** guarded by ever-stronger warriors to buff your team or debuff your enemies. Defeat **"The Overgrowth Darkness"** and the player with the killing blow can summon it as a devastating siege ally.

* **üõ°Ô∏è A New Kind of Defense:** Forget passive towers. **Landmarks** are high-health defensive points that emit a constant, toxic aura, dealing damage over time to any enemy Vessel in range. Pushing a lane is a war of attrition, not a simple tank-and-spank.

## üé≠ The Vessels: Character Archetypes

[cite_start]Choose two Vessels from five distinct archetypes, each a legend reborn from the Keystone Datastream[cite: 36, 48].

* [cite_start]**üõ°Ô∏è Guardians:** Durable front-line protectors who excel at absorbing damage, controlling enemy movement, and defending their allies[cite: 49].

* [cite_start]**‚úä Combaters:** Aggressive melee fighters who thrive in the thick of battle, dealing sustained damage and pursuing high-priority targets[cite: 50].

* [cite_start]**üìñ Specialists:** Masters of area control and unique tactical abilities who manipulate the battlefield with powerful, often zone-based, skills[cite: 51].

* [cite_start]**üéØ Marksmen:** Ranged damage dealers who excel at attacking from a distance, taking down objectives, and eliminating key enemies with precision strikes[cite: 52].

* [cite_start]**‚ö° Enhancers:** Tactical supporters who empower their allies with shields, healing, and other buffs, or disable enemies to turn the tide of a fight[cite: 53].

## üéÆ Game Modes

Whether you crave competition, cooperative challenges, or rich storytelling, Sanctuary has a mode for you.

* ### PvP Modes
  * **Sanctuary Assault (5v5):** The classic MOBA experience. Push lanes, destroy enemy Landmarks, and shatter their Sanctuary. [cite_start]This is the climactic battle of each time loop[cite: 81].

* ### PvE & Single Player Modes
  * **Story Mode (Single Player):** Play through a unique 7-chapter narrative for each Vessel, exploring their backstory and the world of Sanctuary.
  * **Data Heist (1-4 Players):** A standard co-op mission to infiltrate a fortress and secure valuable data.
  * **Sanctuary Siege (1-4 Players):** A horde mode where you defend a Power Core against increasingly difficult waves and powerful bosses.
  * **Giant Hunt (1-4 Players):** A pure boss rush mode. No minions, no objectives‚Äîjust you and your team against a gauntlet of massive bosses.
  * **Cloud Conduit (4-Player Raid):** The pinnacle of PvE content. A sprawling weekly mission with complex puzzles, unique lieutenants, and a multi-phase raid boss.

## üíª Technology Stack

This project is being developed with a web-first approach to ensure maximum accessibility across browsers and devices.

### Client (The Game)
* **Game Framework:** **Phaser.js** or **Babylon.js**. These powerful JavaScript frameworks are ideal for creating high-performance 2D/2.5D games on the HTML5 Canvas.
* **Core Language:** **JavaScript (ES6+)**
* **Styling & UI:** **HTML5** and **CSS3**

### Server (The Backend)
* **Real-time Communication:** **Node.js** with **WebSockets** (using libraries like `Socket.IO` or `ws`). This is essential for handling the real-time multiplayer action.
* **Database:** **MongoDB** or **PostgreSQL** for storing player data, stats, and other persistent information.
* **Hosting Note:** Due to the need for a persistent WebSocket server, standard shared hosting is not sufficient. This project will require a **Virtual Private Server (VPS)** or similar cloud hosting solution (e.g., DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS EC2) that allows running a dedicated Node.js process.
