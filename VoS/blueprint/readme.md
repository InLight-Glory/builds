## About The Game
Tired of the traditional MOBA formula? **Vessels of Sanctuary** breaks the mold. By blending the strategic depth of MOBAs with the fluid, skill-based controls of third-person action games, we're creating an experience that's both familiar and refreshingly new. Every decision matters, from the two Vessels you choose to the unified item build you craft for them. Outwit, outplay, and outlast your opponents in a game where synergy is survival.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **üåÄ The Echo System:** Instantly swap between your two chosen Vessels with a **5-second cooldown**. Dodge lethal blows, create mind-bending combos, and manage two health and energy bars. Your inactive Vessel doesn't heal, so knowing when to fight and when to recall is paramount.

* **üîó Unified Itemization:** A single item build applies to **both** of your Vessels. This creates incredible strategic depth, forcing you to purchase items that benefit your entire pairing. Will you build pure damage and risk a fragile support, or find the perfect hybrid build to make your duo an unstoppable force?

* **‚öîÔ∏è True Action Combat:** No point-and-click. With **WASD movement** and a mouse-driven camera, every move is under your direct control. Land skill shots, dodge attacks, and master a combat system featuring light, heavy, and special ability attacks.

* **üó∫Ô∏è Dynamic Map Objectives:** The jungle is alive with strategic opportunities. Capture asymmetric **Temples** guarded by ever-stronger warriors to buff your team or debuff your enemies. Defeat **"The Overgrowth Darkness"** and the player with the killing blow can summon it as a devastating siege ally.

* **üõ°Ô∏è A New Kind of Defense:** Forget passive towers. **Landmarks** are high-health defensive points that emit a constant, toxic aura, dealing damage over time to any enemy Vessel in range. Pushing a lane is a war of attrition, not a simple tank-and-spank.

## üé≠ The Vessels: Character Archetypes

Choose two Vessels from five distinct archetypes to create your ultimate tag-team duo.

* **Stands:** The unyielding frontline, built to absorb damage and protect allies.
* **Combaters:** High-damage melee assassins who excel at singling out and eliminating key targets.
* **Specialists:** Masters of technology who control the battlefield with chemicals and electricity.
* **Shooters:** Ranged powerhouses who dish out consistent damage from a distance.
* **Assists:** The utility-focused backbone of the team, providing healing, shields, and control.
